This project has built by me as a part off home assignment by moveo.

## The project:

In this project there are two pages.
The main page is the homepage and about page.
The about page exlpain about me and about the app and in the homepage you can see the assignment.
in the homepage there are 8 rows that represent 0 audio loops.
Each of the channels shows the channel's name, has a mute button, a range that shows the progress of the track, and has a unique color.

On the bottom of the page there is a section with control buttons.
Each button effects in a different way on the track:
Play : when pressed all channels start playing simultaneously.
Stop: when pressed all playing channels stop and go back to start.
isLoop: when active, each time the isLoop ends
all channels immediately go back to start and play again .
Pause: when pressed all playing channels stop and and stays at their position.

On the top of the page there is a section with range control.
On that place you can see the progress bar that shows the progress of the song . and you can move manualy to the time that you want .
